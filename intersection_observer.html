<!--
Provides a way to observe changes in the visibility of a target element within
the viewport, or it's visibility within another scrollable element. Chrome 52 (2016), widely supported

You to configure a callback function that is when either:
  - The target element intersects with the viewport or specified element
  - The first time the observer is initialised

CODE: Create HTML, set scene of changing middle boxes colour
CODE: Create intersection observer

Options:
  - root: the element that is used as the viewport for checking the visibility,
          if we want to check it's visibility within the viewport of the document leave it as null
  - rootMargin: Either set a single value or a value each for top, right, bottom, left.
                It will grow or shrink each side of the element's bounding box before working out if
                it is intersecting.
  - threshold: Again, either a single number of an array of numbers which define what percentage of the
               element has to be visible for the callback to be triggered.

CODE: Write callback function

Callback function:
Whenever the target meets a threshold specified, the callback is invoked and it receives a list of entry objects
and the observer. There will be an entry for each target which reported a change in its intersection status.

Debugger and look at what each entry can tell us
  - boundingClientRect: represents the bounds of the target element
  - intersectionRect: represents the target elements visible area
  - time: time at which the intersection was recorded, relative to when the observer was initialised

Tweak options and demo

Other use cases:
 - Lazy-loading of images or other content as a page is scrolled.
 - Implementing "infinite scrolling" web sites, where more and more content is loaded and rendered as you scroll,
   so that the user doesn't have to flip through pages.
 - Reporting of visibility of advertisements in order to calculate ad revenues.
 - Deciding whether or not to perform tasks or animation processes based on whether or not the user will see the result.

---
Why is there entries array just with one thing in it?

An array of IntersectionObserverEntry objects, each representing one threshold which was crossed,
either becoming more or less visible than the percentage specified by that threshold.
